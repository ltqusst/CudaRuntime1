CUDA core is just scalar ALU; GPU executes multiple threads in time-division multiplexing fasion, but unlike CPU:
 - context-switching of HW threads is designed to be very fast (on cycle level);
 - HW-threads keep all states in register files (with stack in mem?), never swap to memory;
 - HW-scheduler is invented to switching context (unlike OS running on CPU using SW-scheduler);
 - thus number of concurrent threads supported are limited by register file size & HW-scheduler capability;
 - HW-threads are grouped in unit of 32 into Warp, to get higher ALU throughput.
 - number of wraps/HW-threads supported is far more than number of CUDA cores(to hide mem-latency).
 
 for example on my GTX-1070, 2048 threads (or 64 warps) per SM are supported,
 but each SM has only 4 Warp schedulers, 16x oversubscride.

## GPU Memory hierarchy
[GPU cache is designed with significant different purpose from CPU's](https://www.rastergrid.com/blog/gpu-tech/2021/01/understanding-gpu-caches/)

**Cache Coherency**
> As a result, GPU caches are usually incoherent, and require explicit flushing
> and/or invalidation of the caches in order to recohere (i.e. to have a coherent
> view of the data between the GPU cores and/or other devices).

**Per Core Instruction Cache**
> One thing to keep in mind from performance point of view is that
> on GPUs an instruction cache miss can potentially stall thousands
> of threads instead of just one, as in the case of CPUs, so generally it¡¯s highly recommended
> for shader/kernel code to be small enough to completely fit into this cache.

**Per Core Data Cache**
> "Thus reuse of cached data on GPUs usually does not happen in the time domain
>  as in case of CPUs (i.e. subsequent instructions of the same thread accessing
>  the same data multiple times), but rather in the spatial domain (i.e. instructions
>  of different threads on the same core accessing the same data).

> Accordingly, using memory as temporary storage and relying on caching for fast
> repeated access is not a good idea on GPUs, unlike on CPUs. However, the larger
> register space and the availability of shared memory make up for that in practice."
